# SimCenterSchema

SimCenter Schema describes the format for SimCenterâ€™s Databases. The schemas define the information stored in Databases holding data used for SimCenter applications and are essential for natural hazards loss estimation studies. The way the schema is designed allows for both deterministic and probabilistic applications and is fully compatible with SimCenter applications.
