# SimCenterSchema

SimCenter Schema describes the format for SimCenterâ€™s Building Inventory Database. The attributes contained within the schema are the building features that were found to be essential to natural hazards los assessment studies. The way the schema is designed allows for both deterministic and probabilistic applications and is fully compatible with other SimCenter applications.
